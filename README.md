This is the documentation of a Rest API for user authentication and authorization. It limits user access to only what has been specifically assigned to them. <br/>
This API was developed as a personal challenge for learning different areas of development, which are:
 - Cybersecurity
 - Web development
 - CI/CD
 - Database Administrator
 - Security and Data Retention Policies
 - Token Management
 - Registration and Audit
 - Integration with Identity Systems

***
